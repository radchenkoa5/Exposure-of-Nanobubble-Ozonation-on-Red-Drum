Focusing on chlorophyll a concentration based on ozone exposure (treatment) and water quality variables.
Using the data from acute exposure in tanks to chose two treatments to move forward with in pond studies.

Data:
-Acute Study: Water quality data, pre & post ozonation with chlorphyll a scores
-Percent chlorophyll a change per tank per treatment, associated with pre-ozonation water quality

Scripts:
Linear Mixed Effects Model for Chlorophyll - building a model to predict chlorophyll concentration based on treatment and temperature

Linear Modeling Code - built a linear model for chlorophyll a and compared to the mixed effects model, also built a model looking at the percent change in chlorophyll a concentration

Figures:
- Figures of linear model for chlorophyll a and percent change in chlorophyll a
