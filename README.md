Focusing on chlorophyll a concentration based on ozone exposure (treatment) and water quality variables.
Decided not to focus on gill damage for this class.

Data:
-Contains a Fake dataset focusing on survial. 
-Fake dataset with gill damage scores and pre-ozonation water quality
-Acute Study: Water quality data, pre & post ozonation with chlorphyll a scores: Used for code review



Scripts:

Chlorophyll a data from a 50% treatment to assess significant decrease in chlorophyll overtime.

Pathway Diagram example: mtcars

Pathway Analysis for Survival: trying to run a path analysis for survival of fish under different treatments - now moving away from survival analysis

Linear Mixed Effects Model for Chlorophyll - building a model to predict chlorophyll concentration based on treatment and temperature

Linear Modeling Code - built a linear model and compared to the mixed effects model - use for code review
